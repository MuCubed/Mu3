Since the release of Pikik, modified Kik clients have been a staple to the Kik community.
With every new feature someone adds, there are several copycats, or skids, who will claim those innovations as their own.

Many of these "skids" have managed to combine code from several others' to create modified Kik clients that are very pleasant to use.
Unfortunately, the original creators of the code used in these clients often don't get recognition and may never have given permission for their code to be used.
As well, there is no telling what other malicious code may be bundled within these modified Kik clients.

The goal of the μ³ project is to provide the means to create a modified Kik client with many enhancements while crediting those whose code is represented.
To do this, certain rules will apply:

1. Code from a given project must be submitted only by the project who created the code in the first place
	- They must do so with full agreement of their entire team
	- They must only upload the code that they have created
	- Code may be maintained or updated by others as needed
3. If a project's code relies on another project, please reach out to them.
4. All code must be submitted with the knowledge that it will be open sourced
	- This allows anyone to fix any broken code, as well as find any malicious code
5. Those who submit code are strongly advised to include with their code a document stating what their code adds and who was involved
6. No code belonging to Kik Interactive or MediaLab may be included.
	- If someone wants to build, they will need to provide their own source for Kik or an alternative and do so taking full responsibility for their actions
	- If your project requires modifying Kik source code, perhaps a build script could do that. I'm not totally sure how to handle this yet
7. No one person shall take credit for the entire project. (Once someone submits code)
	- @AgentOrange96 started this, but the glory should belong to the developers
	
The mechanisms for how this project will work are still very much a WIP. I (@AgentOrange96) professionally develop in Java, but I have extremely limited experience in Android development. So I will not pretend to be an expert. This is designed to be a collaborative effort.
